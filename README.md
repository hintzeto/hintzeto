## Talon Hintze - Data Scientist/Business Analyst

### Who Am I?

I am an data science undergraduate at Brigham Young University - Idaho expecting to graduate in Dec 2024. My undergraduate work has involved various machine learning projects (Polars, PySpark, SKLearn, TensorFlow), statistics (linear and logistic regression), and analytics (R, Python, SQL, PowerBI). I enjoy practical applications of optimization and automation processes.

### Current Projects

* Research and development of an AI Peer Mentoring Bot intended to assess students' understanding levels, and provide teachers and mentors with a learning gap report.
* Metadata cluster analysis for bibliographic records in the Family History Library at Family Search. Find more information [here](https://github.com/Family-Search-Public-Resources)
* Machine learning model to predict convenience store stocking needs in preparation for specific events (natural disasters, holidays, etc)
